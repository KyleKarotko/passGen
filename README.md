Random Password Generator

This was created for the purpose of fulfilling the challenge requirements in module 3. We were to take the starter code (HTML/CSS) and build out the javascript to make the page function to meet the below requirements.

WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
